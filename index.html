<p>Language is one of the most impressive human accomplishments and is believed to be the core to our ability to learn, teach, reason and interact with others [1; 2; 3]. Learning many complex tasks or skills would be significantly more challenging without relying on language to communicate, and language is believed to have a structuring impact on human thought [4; 5; 51]. Written language has also given humans the ability to store information and insights about the world and pass it across generations and continents. Yet, the ability of current state-of-the art reinforcement learning agents to understand natural language is limited.</p>

<p> Practically speaking, the ability to integrate and learn from language, in addition to rewards and demonstrations, has the potential to improve the generalization, scope and sample efficiency of agents [6]. For example, agents that are capable of transferring domain knowledge from textual corpora might be able to much more efficiently explore in a given environment or to perform zero or few shot learning in novel environments [7]. Furthermore, many real-world tasks, including personal assistants and general household robots, require agents to process language by design, whether to enable interaction with humans, or simply use existing interfaces [8; 9].
</p>

<p>To support this field of research, we are interested in fostering the discussion around:</p>
<ul>
	<li> methods that can effectively link language to actions and observations in the environment [10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18];</li>
	<li> research into language roles beyond encoding goal states, such as structuring hierarchical policies [19; 20; 21; 22], communicating domain knowledge [23; 24] or reward shaping [25; 26, 27]; </li>
	<li> methods that can help identify and incorporate outside textual information about the task, or general-purpose semantics learned from outside corpora [28; 29; 30];</li>
	<li> novel environments and benchmarks enabling such research and approaching complexity of real-world problem settings [31; 32; 33; 34; 35; 36].</li>
</ul>
<p>
The aim of the workshop on Language in Reinforcement Learning is to steer discussion and research of these problems by bringing together researchers from several communities, including reinforcement learning, robotics, natural language processing, computer vision and cognitive psychology. 
Since the last edition of LaReL at ICML 2020 [45; 46], we have seen a wealth of papers leveraging language to support or enhance cognitive functions in artificial agents: systematic generalization [37; 17], relational and causal learning [38], abstraction and planning [39; 40; 41] or goal imagination [42]. These results revive the old debate on the cognitive functions of language [43; 44] and let us foresee new ways for language to support artificial agents’ cognitive abilities beyond goal and reward specification. We have also seen more work on transfer of commonsense knowledge from pretrained large language models (LLMs) [47; 48] beyond linguistic tasks to sequential decision making settings. Recent work has shown how LLMs can be used as planners [39; 49; 50], enabling learning in sparse data settings and to assist out of distribution generalization to novel tasks.</p>

<p>In the wake of tremendous progress on multimodal models, NLP, and RL, in this workshop we will try to take a step back and focus discussion on upcoming challenges in integrating language and sequential decision-making. We will prepare some hot questions as well as collect community-contributed questions through our website and social media; we will then focus the panel discussion on some of these questions as well as host an open breakout rooms session where all attendants can contribute to the discussion around those open problems.<p>

Some example questions:
<ul>
<li>How can knowledge stored in a pretrained language model be transferred to an RL policy ?</li>
<li>How can we update a language model from feedback in an environment ?</li>
<li>How can we build open-ended environments for language-using agents ?</li>
<li>Can general language agents be trained from imitation learning alone or is feedback from an environment required ?</li>
<li>How can we specify reward or collect data for language agents at scale ?</li>
</ul>
