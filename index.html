<p>The Socially Responsible Language Modelling Research (SoLaR) workshop at NeurIPS 2024 is an interdisciplinary gathering that aims to foster responsible and ethical research in the field of language modeling. Recognizing the significant risks and harms [33-37] associated with the development, deployment, and use of language models, the workshop emphasizes the need for researchers to focus on addressing these risks starting from the early stages of development. The workshop brings together experts and practitioners from various domains and academic fields with a shared commitment to promoting fairness, equity, accountability, transparency, and safety in language modeling research.</p>

Given the wide-ranging impacts of LMs, our workshop will welcome a broad array of submissions.
We briefly detail some specific topic areas and an illustrative selection of pertinent works:
<ul>
<li> Security and privacy concerns of LMs [13, 30, 25, 49, 55].
<li> Bias and exclusion in LMs [12, 2, 26, 53, 44].
<li> Analysis of the development and deployment of LMs, including crowdwork [42, 50], deploy-
ment protocols [52, 47], and societal impacts from deployment [10, 21].
<li> Safety, robustness, and alignment of LMs [51, 8, 35, 32, 7].
<li> Auditing, red-teaming, and evaluations of LMs [41, 40, 29, 15, 11].
<li> Examination of risks and harms from any novel input and/or output modalities that are
introduced in LMs [14, 28, 54].
<li> Transparency, explainability, interpretability of LMs [39, 17, 3, 46, 22, 38].
<li> Applications of LMs for social good, including sector-specific applications [9, 31, 16] and LMs
for low-resource languages [4, 5, 36].
<li> Perspectives from other domains that can inform socially responsible LM development and
deployment [48, 1].
</ul>
<b>We will also have a separate track, with a separate reviewer pool, for sociotechnical
submissions</b> from disciplines such as philosophy, law, and policy. We provide a brief illustrative
list of works we would welcome:
<ul>
<li> Studies on economic impacts of LMs, e.g., labor-market disruptions [18, 34].
<li>Risk assessment [33, 24, 37, 23].
<li> Regulation and governance of LMs [45, 6, 27].
<li> Philosophical examination of concepts related to alignment, safety [19, 43, 20].
</ul>
